  - On-site PVA starts at $.2 a gram
- *Please compress your files into a tarball and/or gnu gzip archive.*  
  - 3d prints must be in `.obj`, `.step` or  `.3mf` format; relying on ASCII `.stl` is discouraged.
Lasercut submissions must be in `.dwg`, `.dxf`, `.pdf` or `.svg` format; Inkscape SVG or PDF 1.5 are preferred formats.
  - *All additional project, documentation and CAD files are welcome and appreciated.*

### Filaments, properties, sources & costs: 


We strongly encourage users of the DLA Makerspace to purchase their own materials for printing, laser cutting and milling from our whitelist of sources.  While we endeavor to maintain a stock of materials for purchase and immediate use on site, it will always be much more cost efficient to purchase your own materials prior to utilizing our equipment.

### Where to buy filament:  

Note, to use the DLA Makerspace‚Äôs 3D printing equipment you **must use materials from this whitelist of manufacturers** or received written permission to use an alternate filament from Jess.

### Where to buy lasercutting stock:

*Note, we ***will not*** process recycled woods or untraceable / unlabeled polymers. It is extremely dangerous to process chemically treated wood, many insulation additives and many paints, particularly older exterior paints and stains.*
- **Clean, recycled cardboard üëç**

### *PLA (Polylactic acid): Sources &  properties*

- PLA by nature is a semicrystalline thermoplastic with a very low glass transition temperature.  Because of this, we can drastically modify its characteristics as a material, including properties such as tensile strength, heat deflection point, shore hardness and density.  These properties can be exploited using heat, pressure and solvents.  These parameters can all be utilized, modified and explored at the DLA Makerspace and the Ithaca Generator Makerspace.  Curious about advanced manufacturing & post processing techniques with PLA?   Contact Jess!  
- PLA is the most common 3d printer filament material
- PLA is often underestimated or overlooked as an extremely capable material
- PLA is primarily manufactured from corn
- PLA is relatively easy to recycle
- PLA does not release styrene or any other common caustic vapors

### ***Filaments we recommend for most projects and uses:***

[**FormFutura 3mm filaments:**](https://www.formfutura.com/shop){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

- FormFutura is a very large manufacturer of filament based in the Netherlands. They are generally considered one of the more advanced facilities for experimental thermoplastic filaments.  FormFutura is responsible for manufacturing numerous well known, heavily marketed brands.

 - Their ‚ÄúPremium PLA‚Äù and ‚ÄúVolcano PLA‚Äù are both awesome and usually the best choice for most projects and use cases.
  - the effective differences among FormFutura's PLA products is primarily the amount of volumetric change above the glass transition temperature we can expect.


[**PolyMaker 3mm filaments:**](https://us.polymaker.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}

- Polymaker is a manufacturer of filaments based in China with a focus on environmental longevity.  Their product line is limited in breadth but extremely affordable, globally available and manufactured / shipped responsibly.


[**Snolabs 1.75mm PLA filaments:**](https://snolabs.com/pla/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}
- **Sno Labs is no longer is pursuing 3mm filaments;  1.75mm filaments currently can be processed at [the Ithaca Generator](https://ithacagenerator.org/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, and on most modern 3d printing equipment.**
- Snolabs is a local New York company that specializes in visually pleasing and high end PLA filaments.  They tend to be very competitively priced, and are very, very fast with local New York shipping.

##### Slicer Links: <br>

<h4 id="prusaslicer"> </h4>     

  - [PrusaSlicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/drivers/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} *(Linux AppImage, Mac, Windows)* <br>
    - PrusaSlicer is a fork of and a sort of spiritual successor to the [Slic3r](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} project.  It is primarily maintained and developed by Prusa Research, a 3d printer company based in Prague with an extensive, mutualistic relationship with the [RepRap](https://reprap.org/wiki/RepRap){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Marlin](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} communities.  <br>


<h4 id="superslicer"> </h4>     

  - [SuperSlicer Source](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} <br>
    -   SuperSlicer is a fork of PrusaSlicer, and is popular among highly experimental and bleeding edge rapid fabrication groups including the [Voron](https://github.com/VoronDesign){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"},  [DoomCube](https://discord.gg/doomcube){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"},  [RatRig](https://ratrig.dozuki.com/c/Rat_Rig_V-Core_3){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} & [HevORT](http://docs.hevort.com/#/pages/home){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} communities.


<h4 id="ulticura"> </h4>     

  - [Ultimaker Cura](https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} *(Linux AppImage, Mac, Windows)* <br>
    -  Cura originated as a Free & Open Source slicer project.  Unfortunately Cura has been since been absorbed into Ultimaker as a primarily proprietary freemium software closely tied to Ultimakers products.  To fully utilize the DLA Makerspace's Ultimaker equipment, user's must begrudgingly use this proprietary fork.  


<h4 id="lulzcura"> </h4>     

  - [Lulzbot / Fargo Cura Source](https://gitlab.com/lulzbot3d/cura-le){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} Lulzbot also maintains a fork of Cura; unlike the Ultimaker Cura fork, Lulzbot's fork is remains a properly FOSS project and continues to symbiotically benefit from end user contributions and community input.
