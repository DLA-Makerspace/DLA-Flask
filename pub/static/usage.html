<h3 id="dla-makerspace-usage-policy">DLA Makerspace Usage Policy</h3>

<h5 id="research-design-and-prototype---but-manufacture-elsewhere">Research, Design and Prototype - but Manufacture Elsewhere!</h5>

<p>The DLA Makerspace is not a production facility. Similar to the Fab Lab Charter, commercial activities may be prototyped, researched and incubated in DLA Makerspace, however they should grow beyond rather than within our space.</p>

<p>Specifically, if you intend to create more than ~10 of your item, in particular with 3D printing, we strongly urge you to explore production methods beyond those offered with the rapid fabrication technology available at the DLA Makerspace. When you are ready to go beyond your prototype and grow your commercial activity, please consult with Jess for commercial manufacturing resources.</p>

<h5 id="weapon-making-is-banned">Weapon Making Is Banned</h5>
<p>This includes parts of weapons, ammunition, defensive as well as offensive weapons. If you aren’t sure what constitutes a weapon, please consult a staff member.</p>

<h5 id="tools-of-vandalism-are-banned">Tools of Vandalism are Banned</h5>
<p>Items produced in DLA Makerspace may not be used in a way that violates university posting policies or local, state, or federal laws regarding vandalism. If you have any questions about this policy, please consult a staff member.</p>

<h5 id="legal-and-lawful">Legal and Lawful</h5>
<p>The DLA Makerspace rapid fabrication technology may only be used for lawful purposes. No one is permitted to create material that is: Prohibited by local, state, or federal law. In violation of another’s intellectual property rights. For example, the printers will not be used to reproduce material that is subject to copyright, patent or trademark protection.</p>

<h4 id="consequences-for-policy-violations"><em>Consequences For Policy Violations</em></h4>

<p>Access to The DLA Makerspace’s services is a privilege and not a right. Makerspace users are responsible for learning and following the policies. Knowingly or unknowingly violating the Makerspace’s policies does come with consequences. The exact consequences vary depending on the nature of the situation, and will be decided by staff members. Possible consequences for violating DLA Makerspace policies include having campus security and police notified, as well as potential legal action. The severity of the consequence will be matched with the severity of the policy infraction.</p>

<h5 id="right-to-refusal">Right to Refusal</h5>
<p>The DLA Makerspace reserves the right to refuse any 3D print request.</p>

<h5 id="wysiwyg">WYSIWYG</h5>
<p>The DLA Makerspace cannot guarantee model quality or functionality. Responsibility for removing rafts and supports is up to the user.</p>

<h5 id="pick-up-policy">Pick up policy</h5>
<p>Items must be picked up by the individual who submitted them or their designee, using valid ID and payment. Items not picked up within 14 days after being printed become the property of The DLA Makerspace.</p>

<h5 id="access">Access</h5>
<ol>
  <li>Only designated staff members, vetted faculty and staff will have hands-on access to our fabrication tools.</li>
  <li>Access to equipment is prioritized based on factors such as academic priority, class due dates, reprints, machine functionality and other issues as they arise. We reserve the right to alter queue order based on these factors.</li>
  <li>To best accommodate large orders, please contact us 4-6 weeks prior to your “need by” date. For instructors, please contact us at the beginning of the semester so we can coordinate the best time for your class to submit their projects.</li>
